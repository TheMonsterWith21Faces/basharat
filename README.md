# Bash-A-Rat
A fantasy TTRPG version of baccarat, but based on violent rodent murder.

Invented by a forward-thinking croupier that got Employee of the Month for creating a new gambling opportunity AND helping the casino's rat infestation problem.

Make a wager, start the round and either choose a box or choose "no rat." 90% of the time, a rat will be in one of the boxes. Smash it to death and win 2x your money. About 10% of the time the casino will choose not to include a rat in one of the boxes. If you choose "no rat" during one of those times you get 10x your bet.
